# Vaccine finder
This is just a little toy to play with the Go programming language,
but it does have a use. It finds the locations for COVID-19 vaccination
in San Diego and search them all to see which ones have doses. This can
help you quickly find out what is available. (There are no guarantees it 
works correctly.)
